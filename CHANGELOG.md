The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

`browser-control-mcp` is the successor of `chrome-debug-mcp` 1.5.6 and starts
from a copy of its code: entries describe the differences from that release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project scaffolding: quality gates (`make check`: format, clippy with
  warnings as errors, tests, docs, duplication, packaging and version
  consistency), CI on Linux, macOS and Windows, `AGENTS.md`, MIT licence.
- The server code of chrome-debug-mcp 1.5.6 (35 tools, Chrome over CDP),
  copied without its history and renamed: crate and binary
  `browser-control-mcp`, server title "Browser Control MCP".

### Changed
- `cdp-browser-lite`'s test mocks are no longer linked into the binary.
- Dependencies updated to their latest releases; unused test dependencies
  (`hyper`, `hyper-util`, `http-body-util`, `futures-util`,
  `tokio-tungstenite`) removed.
